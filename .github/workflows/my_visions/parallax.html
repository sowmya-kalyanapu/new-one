                JavaScript classes, introduced in ES6, provide a way to create objects using a more structured syntax, similar to classes in other object-oriented programming languages. They serve as blueprints for creating objects (instances) with shared properties and methods. While JavaScript is prototype-based, classes offer syntactic sugar, making it easier to work with object-oriented concepts.
                A class is defined using the class keyword, followed by the class name and curly braces containing the class body. The class body can include a constructor, methods, and properties.

            <p>In Java, an object is a fundamental concept of object-oriented programming (OOP). It is a self-contained entity that encapsulates state (data) and behavior (methods). An object is an instance of a class, which acts as a blueprint for creating objects. 
                Key characteristics of objects:
                    State:
                    Represents the data or attributes of an object. It is stored in instance variables, also known as fields.
                    Behavior:
                    Defines the actions or operations that an object can perform. It is implemented through methods.
                    Identity:
                    Distinguishes one object from another. Each object has a unique identity, even if their state is the same.</p>

            <p>Abstraction in Java is a core object-oriented programming concept that focuses on hiding complex implementation details and exposing only essential information to the user. It simplifies the interaction with objects by providing a high-level view, allowing programmers to concentrate on what an object does rather than how it achieves it. Abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces. 
                An abstract class cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods (methods without a body). Subclasses of an abstract class must provide implementations for these abstract methods, unless the subclass is also declared abstract.
